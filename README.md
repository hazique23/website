   	According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva, 18 one of three principal deities along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.<br><br>

The Pandavas, the protagonists of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, are said to have visited the city in search of Shiva to atone for their sin of fratricide and Brāhmanahatya that they had committed during the climactic Kurukshetra War. 201 It is regarded as one of seven holy cities (Sapta Puri) which can provide Moksha; Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Kashi, Kanchi, Avanti, and Dvārakā are the seven cities known as the givers of liberation. <br><br>

		Hindu epic shares the creative principles and human values found in epic everywhere. However, the particular details vary and its diversity is immense, according to Doniger.[8] The Hindu legends embed the Indian thought about the nature of existence, the human condition and its aspirations through an interwoven contrast of characters, the good against the evil, the honest against the dishonest, the dharma-bound lover against the anti-dharma bully, the gentle and compassionate against the cruel and greedy. In these epics, everything is impermanent including matter, love and peace. Magic and miracles thrive, gods are defeated and fear for their existence, triggering wars or debates. Death threatens and re-threatens life, while life finds a way to creatively re-emerge thus conquering death. Eros persistently prevails over chaos.<br><br>

The Hindu epics integrate in a wide range of subjects. They include stories about how and why cosmos originated (Hindu cosmology, cosmogony), how and why humans or all life forms originated (anthropogony) along with each's strengths and weaknesses, how gods originated along with each's strengths and weaknesses (theogony), the battle between good gods and bad demons (theomachy), human values and how humans can live together, resolve any disagreements (ethics, axiology), healthy goals in stages of life and the different ways in which each individual can live (householder, monk, purusartha), the meaning of all existence and means of personal liberation (soteriology) as well as legends about what causes suffering, chaos and the end of time with a restart of a new cycle (eschatology).

   Chandradeva, founder of the Gahadavala dynasty made Banaras a second capital in 1090. 291 After fall of Pala Empire, the Chero dynasty ruled Varanasi till Mughal rule.<br><br>

Varanasi remained a centre of activity for intellectuals and theologians during the Middle Ages, which further contributed to its reputation as a cultural centre of religion and education. Several major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir who was born here in 1389, 32) and Ravidas, a 15th-century socio-religious reformer, mystic, poet, traveller, and spiritual figure, who was born and lived in the city and employed in the tannery industry.<BR><BR>
Varanasi experienced a Hindu cultural revival in the 16th century under the Mughal emperor Akbar, who invested in the city and funded to build two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu. The Raja of Pune established the Annapurna Mandir, and the 200-metre (660 ft) Akbari Bridge was also completed during this period. The earliest tourists began arriving in the city during the 16th century. In 1665, the French traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier described the architectural beauty of the Vindu Madhava temple on the side of the Ganges.

	 	The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947, during the reign of Dr. Vibhuti Narayan Singh. In the 18th century, Muhammad Shah ordered the construction of an observatory on the Ganges, attached to Man Mandir Ghat, designed to discover imperfections in the calendar in order to revise existing astronomical tables. Tourism in the city began to flourish in the 18th century. In 1791, under the rule of the British Governor-General Warren Hastings, Jonathan Duncan founded a Sanskrit College in Varanasi. In 1867, the establishment of the Varanasi Municipal Board led to significant improvements in the city's infrastructure and basic amenities of health services, drinking water supply and sanitation <br> <br>

Author Mark Twain wrote in 1897 of Varanasi, "Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together." In 1910, the British made Varanasi a new Indian state, with Ramnagar as its capital, but with no jurisdiction over the city proper. The religious head, Kashi Naresh, has had his headquarters at the Ramnagar Fort since the 18th century, also a repository of the history of the kings of Varanasi, which is situated to the east of Varanasi, across the Ganges. The Kashi Naresh is deeply revered by the local people and the chief cultural patron; some devout inhabitants consider him to be the incarnation of Shiva.<br><br> Varanasi was ceded to the Union of India in 1947, becoming part of Uttar Pradesh after Indian independence. Vibhuti Narayan Singh incorporated his territories into the United Provinces in 1949</p><br><br>

   	Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre, famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. During the time of Gautama Buddha, Varanasi was part of the Kingdom of Kashi. 231 The Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath. The celebrated Chinese traveller Xuanzang, also known as Hiuen Tsiang, who visited the city around 635 CE, attested that the city was a centre of religious and artistic activities, and that it extended for about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) along the western bank of the Ganges. <br><br>

   	 When Xuanzang, visited Varanasi in the 7th century, he named it "Polonise" (NEW) and wrote that the city had some 30 temples with about 30 monks.  The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi.<br><br>

	 	In the 16th century, Varanasi had a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu. Much of what is considered modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the Maratha and Bhumihar Brahmin kings. The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city is governed by the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the Parliament of India by the current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, who won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by a huge margin. <br><br>Silk weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do the Banaras Locomotive Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals. Varanasi Hospital's foundation stone was laid by governor Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi in 1954 and it was inaugurated by president S. Radhakrishnan in 1964.<br><br>

Varanasi has been a cultural centre of northern India for several thousand years, and is closely associated with the Ganges. Hindus believe that dying here and getting cremated along the banks of the "holy" Ganges river allows one to break the cycle of rebirth and attain salvation,[14] making it a major center for pilgrimage. The city is known worldwide for its many ghats, embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat, and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead. The Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here.</p><br><br>

   Varanasi's music tradition is traced to the Pauranic days. According to ancient legend, Shiva is credited with evolving music and dance forms. During the medieval era, Vaishnavism, a Bhakti movement, grew in popularity, and Varanasi became a thriving center for musicians such as Surdas, Kabir, Ravidas, Meera and Tulsidas. During the monarchic rule of Govind Chandra in the 16th century, the Dhrupad style of singing received royal patronage and led to other related forms of music such as Dhamar, Hori, and Chaturang. Presently the Dhrupad maestro Pandit

Ritwik Sanyal from Varanasi is working for the revival

of this art-music.

Under Muslim rulers, the Nawab of Awadh, the Nirgun singers of Kashi not only popularized the Assarwari, "Ghunghat ke pat Khol" song but also popularized the singing concerts such as festivals on the boats floating on the Ganges River. Some of the popular festivals were Jhoola, Jhoomar, Kajri, Birha, Dangal and Gulab Bari, a tradition which is continued even today

	 	In recent times, the tutelary head, the Maharajas of Kashi of Varanasi, particularly Maharaj Prabhu Narayan Singh, have patronized music. During the Moghal Emperor Bahadur Shah II's reign, the noted musicians were Waris Ali, Akbar Ali, Nisar Khan, Sadiq Ali and Ashiq Ali Khan. Ali Mohammad and Ali Bux, the sons of Basat Khan, who were hailed as the "jewels" of the Royal court of Kashi. During this time, the local music styles which developed were the Banarasi Thumri, Dadra, Chaiti, Hori, Bhairavi, Kajri, Tarana, Ghato and many more. <br><br> In addition, new forms were created such as Tirwat, Sadra, Khamsa, Lavni, Chaturang, Sargam, Ragmala, Kirtan, Qauwali, Kathagayan, Bhajan and Ramayan kirtan. Two hundred years ago, Pandit Ram Sahai developed the Benares gharana of the tabla, and within this genre, the notable musicians include Kishan Maharaj, Samta Prasad, Kumar Bose, and Samar Saha. A class of musicians, gandharva, train their daughters in music and dancing.<br><br>

The Varanasi School of Music that has evolved is very similar to the Lucknow style (gharana) of music and has also imbued local folk traditions of chaiti and kajri. This form of music spread quickly. Shankara Deva, a devotional music singer saint in his own right, was instrumental in composing Bhakthi songs.Biajis, a courtesan sect of Varanasi, are credited with maintaining and contributing to the traditions of Hindustani music and dance in Varanasi.</p> <br><br>

    Ganga Aarti (ritual of offering prayer to the Ganges river) is held daily at dusk. Several priests perform this ritual by carrying deepam and moving it up and down in a rhythmic tune of bhajans. 2 Special aartis are held on Tuesdays and on religious festivals.<BR><BR>

The Ganga Aarti starts soon after sunset and lasts for about 45 minutes. In summer the Aarti begins at about 7pm due to late sunsets and in winter it starts at around 6pm. Hundreds of people gather at the ghat every evening to watch the event.

<br><br>

Ganga puja is celebrated after the Navanna festival, which marks the rice harvest. Its date is variable, but falls in March or April. It worships the river goddess of the Ganga, or Ganges, one of the fourteen foremost deities of Tripura. On this occasion, tribal communities assemble on the banks of a stream or river and "pare three pieces of bamboo into beautiful flowers".[citation needed] After this they build a temporary temple in the middle of the stream, also made out of bamboo, and hold celebrations reverently. Adult male geese, goats, and even buffalo are sacrificed to the gods, in the belief that through such offerings the gods may use their power to prevent epidemic diseases.[citation needed] Another purpose of the festival is that the gods are reverently asked to ensure the well-being of pregnant women. Throughout the state of Tripura traditional dance forms part of the festival of worship.

		The priests in-charge of performing the aarti sport dhoti and kurta well-tied with a long gamcha (or towel). They prepare the set-up by gathering five elevated planks, a layered brass lamp, idol of Ganga Devi, flowers, incense sticks, conch shell and other ritual paraphernalia. Eager devotees throng the site from across the city to witness the awe-inspiring spectacle; many others take a boat ride from the opposite banks of Ganga River and get the boat parked on the banks of Dashashwamedh ghat. Only the learned pundits of Vedas and Upanishads are involved in performing the aarti, and they are headed by the priest of Gangotri Seva Samiti.<br><br>

		The Ganga aarti of Varanasi is a shining beacon of devotion and bliss that makes us experience the divinity in and around us. Since ages, no day has gone by when the holy Ganga River has not been adored. It is one of the must-see activities included in every traveller’s itinerary, and people from all walks of life visit the city with the desire of beholding the Ganga aarti.<br><br>
		Once the time for wonderful event arrives, getting a place to watch it could turn out to be an overwhelming reality. So, the way out is to plan in advance.
The aarti takes place daily at 6:30 PM post sundown in summer and 7:00 PM in winters for about 45 minutes. The venue is Dashashwamedh ghat, one of the holiest of all ghats in Varanasi. An announcement at 7:00 PM takes place to inform the attendees about the commencement of aarti.</p><br><br>
